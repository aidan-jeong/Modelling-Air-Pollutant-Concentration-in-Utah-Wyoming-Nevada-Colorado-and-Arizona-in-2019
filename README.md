# Modelling Air Pollutant Concentration in Utah Wyoming Nevada Colorado and Arizona in 2019
This study aims to investigate the spatial patterns and distribution of air pollution concentrations in Utah and its four contiguous states in the United States, 
focusing on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). By using Spatial interpolation methods such as IDW and Kriging,
air pollutant concentration surfaces were produced to demonstrate their spatial patterns.
